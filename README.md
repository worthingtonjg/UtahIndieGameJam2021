### Dr Strange - 2021 Utah Indie Game Jam Entry 

The theme for this 48 hour game jam was "Reincarnation".  Meet Dr. Strange!  He is a crazy scientist obsessed with discovering the secret to **reincarnation** at all costs.

#### Challenges
- What made this game jam more challenging was that both Nathan and Ryan had to work most of Saturday, so had less time to help.
- Also Jim Byer decided not to help us much, but did add his own mini-game, which we included in the menu.
- We had a new team member this year (Nicholas Terry) and had to learn to work as a team with someone we hadn't worked with before.

#### Contributors
- Nathan: Level Design and Animation Rigging
- Ryan: Level Design, Animation Rigging, Sounds and Music
- Me: I worked on the Cut Scenes, Story, Navmesh AI and Programming, Ship Flying mini-game, UI, Particle Effects
- Nick: Character Controller, Interactables, Modeling
- Jim: Shooter mini-game
- Most the artwork was free from the asset store

#### Result

- We won the award for Best Narrative.
